1. Saw some interesting numbers on the Biden economy today, the loss of $75 billion in the market since the lifetime lying dog faced pony soldier politician took over as president! Yet, there are those who say we aren’t in a recession? Certified dingleheads!@jamesbulltard7 Means we are in a recession already. They haven’t even turned student loans back on. Lmao
2. There are private landlords in every country except communist countries. We have social housing for those who qualify. We have a housing shortage unfortunately will take a number of years to address unless we have a recession.  A recession would fix it fast.
3. 1/4 actually. So they are actually saving us from a really bad recession by keeping things at a decent value which they have to do. The inflation isn’t that bad. We have a mild recession in late 2023, but that’s better than what everyone’s expected meaning we making moves.
4. Up is down, down is up. You are a massive success! Our economy isn’t in a recession! Stock market isn’t crashing! We don’t have a crime crisis, border crisis or inflation crisis! Everything is great! You are such a competent president. It’s Opposite Day I guess! #BidenFails
5. Say it again for the people in the back. AMEN. We are hitting a recession if we are already not in one. Truly sad for people to be so hidden to that fact
6. We are in a recession. All numbers are down across the board. I'm in the entertainment business. My income is definitely lower these last few months compared to last year. People don't have extra cash for leisure activities this year compared to past year.  It not just NFTs.
7. How many times do we have to tell you people? We are in a recession whether the government wants to admit it or not and interest rates are at 20-year highs! That affects people's ability to make major purchases. Tesla is absolutely killing it with 35% growth.
8. We are in a recession, atleast once a week women should send money to their bfs especially if the use is to buy beer.
9. Are we in a recession? Experts say it's not a matter of "if" but "when"
10. @RobertKennedyab @MBjegovic @elerianm @WSJ Marko is a grifting liar. Everyone in the US knows we are already well within a recession.
