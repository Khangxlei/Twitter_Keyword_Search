Na  not to me really. I’m tired of this whole being scared of the Celtics who don’t really look great vs the hawks. Tbh I think the sixers are better. And I think they are going to the finals. Thought for a while now. As a fan I’m tired of being this one roundOh brother he was cooking France in that WC semi finals, i honestly supported Belgium for that world cup , sadly they couldn't score. He looks fat now and idk it looks he is scared to dribble , lost all his confidence. I would rather see him retire than see him play like this@KloppSznn It’s so embarrassing 
It’s so embarrassing Trent and Reece have lit done in in UCL finals Trent has scared the shit out of prem attackers for years Reece does that and has the respect of some of the best wingers in he world (leao and Vini etc) It boggles my mind how any of them can say AWB
